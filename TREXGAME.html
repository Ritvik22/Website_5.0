        <p> The TREX Game is a new and improved version of googles, no-internet game. Now, you can play it on internet, without having to turn your wifi off! Meaning, you can have several google tabs open, and you dont have to worry about the  NO INTERNET page. You should deffinetly play this game, and ignore all spelling mistakes that signal that this game is not profsional. Thank you.</p>
